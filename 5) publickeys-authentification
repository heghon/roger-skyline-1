For that part, normally, the access of your VM is already set to be used with public keys. 
Anyway, you will need to change the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
find here the line #PubkeyAuthentication yes

if you already have yes put here, this is nice, relax for a seond and stretch.
if not put a yes, then relax and stretch.
uncomment the line (or not because it's normally put as a yes) and then it's done.

Et voil√† !

Now you probably want to know how this work.
Well, first you need to create a new user on your VM.
After you'll need to create keys for the connection on the host, for that : ~ ssh-keygen
the keys will be standards but you can change it (RTFM)

you know have your keys in the host machine, you nedd to give them to the client, and for that : 
~ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@ip_machine

the ssh connection is now normally possible (ssh user@ip_machine)
