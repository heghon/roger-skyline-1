For that part, normally, the access of your VM is already set to be used with ublic keys. 
Anyway, you will need to change the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
find here the line #PubkeyAuthentication yes

if you already have yes put here, this is nice, relax for a seond and stretch.
if not put a yes, then relax and stretch.
uncomment the line (or not because it's normally put as a yes) and then it's done.

Et voil√† !
