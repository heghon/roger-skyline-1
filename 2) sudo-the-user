In order to allow a user to use sudo, you need to add him in the sudoers file.
You can find this file here : /etc/sudoers or use the command : ~ (sudo) visudo 

You have to add a line under : #includedir /etc/sudoers.d : 
username    ALL=(ALL) ALL

But ! if you want every user to be sudo even if they are not even created, the line is : 
ALL    ALL=(ALL) ALL

Also, passwords are a lot of troubles (nice for security, but here let me tell you that here I don't need them).
So here, I can add :
ALL    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
or 
username    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

when it's done, save the file and reboot the machine (just to be sure).

Et voil√† !
