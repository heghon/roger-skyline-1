Now, you need to write a script that will do a update, and an upgrade of evrey packet you have on your machine.

Mine looks like that : 

#! /bin/sh

apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade > /var/log/update_script.log

not that scary...
anyway don't forget to make your script an executable : 
~ (sudo) chmod 755 <nameofyourfile.sh>
~ (sudo) chmod +x <nameofyourfile.sh>

after that it is asked that this file has to be runned every boot and once a week at 4am.
For that :
~ (sudo) crontab -e

inside the crontab file, atht bottom, you can now place tasks like this : 

@reboot /home/baptiste/upgrade-script.sh    <-- script launched at every boot.
0 4 * * 1 /home/baptiste/upgrade-script.sh  <-- script launched once a week at 4am.

reboot now and llok that you don't need to upgrade anything now.

Et voilÃ  !
