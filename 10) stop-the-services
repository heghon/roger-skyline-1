We need now to stop all the services that have no use for this project. 
How do we know first what services are running actually ? well you could use : ~ (sudo) service --status-all

you have now all the services running but how do we know which one is useful and wich one is not ? 
Well, it's Google time !
if you don't want to search everything online you can just do what I done but that's your problem...

The services I stopped are : 
  Apache_htcacheclean : used to clean the memory of cache data. well as we don't go on the internet very often, it's not really useful.
  Dbus : it's an inter-process communication system, but we don't use a lot of them and the user that can use it is root, anyway, not really useful
  
  and for the rest, I'm pretty sure they are useful, but I can be wrong.
  Anyway, that's all for now so et voil√† !
