For this one you will have several things to do.

First, you need to open the file : /etc/network/interfaces
You will have normally 2 interfaces, one called lo (don't touch it), and one called enp0s3 or something.
If there is no problem, you will see this line : iface enp0s3 inet dhcp ; you can translate that with : the VM use the dhcp service to connect to the internet.
But we don't want that so it's time to define an ip address for the machine.

To define this address erase the word dhcp, then replace it with static, like that : 
iface enp0s3 inet static
under this line, you'll have to define some things :
the address : address xx.xx.xx.xx <-- adress is in function of your own ip address, the 2 first numbers have to be the same.
the netmask : netmask 255.255.255.252 <-- in order to have a /30 netmask
the gateway : gateway xx.xx.xx.xx <-- the same as your own gateway (google is your friend to find it ... or ifconfig)

so it will look like (at least for me): 
# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
	address 10.11.142.157
	netmask 255.255.255.252
	gateway 10.11.254.254
  
  Then, a reboot will be necessary and now you can connect with ssh.
  
Et voilÃ  !
