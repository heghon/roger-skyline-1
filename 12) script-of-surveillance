You need here to make a scrit for that little task, and here it is : 

first make a copy of the famous file you need to look at inside /etc : ~ (sudo) cp crontab crontab_backup

then make a script in your home for example.
This could look like that : 

#! /bin/bash

if cmp -s "$/etc/crontab" "$/etc/crontab_backup"
  then
    sudo echo "nobody changed crontab !"
  else
    sudo echo  "someone tried and succeded to modify crontab." | mail -s "avertissement" root@debianVM
    sudo rm -rf /etc/crontab_backup
    sudo cp /etc/crontab /etc/crontab_backup
  fi
  
  you compare the 2 files ans send a mail only if a difference is seen.
  Then you delete the backup file and you copy the new one then.
  
again, don't forget to make your script an executable : 
~ (sudo) chmod 755 <nameofyourfile.sh>
~ (sudo) chmod +x <nameofyourfile.sh>

now crontab again, at the bottom, you can now place tasks like this : 

0 0 * * * /home/baptiste/upgrade-script.sh    <-- script launched every day at midnight

et voilÃ  !
