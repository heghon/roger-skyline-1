For this part, normally with the creation of your VM, it is asked to creat also a first user.
So give him a little name, with a little password and boom you have your user!

By the way, during the same creation of this VM, you will "create" the root user (with another password).

For those wondering how to create a user in the VM, well it goes like that :
if your user is a sudoer, just use sudo before the following command :
if the user isn't, you need to use root (command : ~ su) and then . the command :
~ (sudo) adduser <username> 

then, this appears :

Adding user `username' ...
Adding new group `username' (1001) ...
Adding new user `username' (1001) with group `username' ...
Creating home directory `/home/username' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password:

don't be scared and give a password for the new folk you added.

then : 

passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for username
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []:
	Room Number []:
	Work Phone []:
	Home Phone []:
	Other []:
Is the information correct? [Y/n]

you can choose to let these informations empty or not but don't forget to answer yes at the end.

Et voilÃ  !

(to remove a user, use 'userdel' --> RTFM)
