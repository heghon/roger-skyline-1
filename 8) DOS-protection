More protection ! I love it ! by the way go out covered.
you should look first on the internet what DOS attacks are, then in order to protect you machine from them, fail2ban is a solution.

first things first : ~ (sudo) apt install fail2ban

you then have to configure it here : /etc/fail2ban

you don't have to touch /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf normally (but if you want you can)
/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf contains the default jails, that can be activated on /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/defaults-debian.conf (debian or ubuntu)

my file looks like this : 

[DEFAULT]
ignoreip = 10.11.142.157/30 <-- I don't want to ban myself

[sshd] <-- first jail for ssh connections

enabled  = true
port     = ssh,1313 <-- or 1313 in my case
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
bantime	 = 120 <-- 2minutes of bantime
maxretry = 5 <-- 5 tries before ban

[apache] <-- second jail for web connections

port     = http,https
logpath  = %(apache_error_log)s
bantime	 = 3600
maxretry = 4

And it is now done, a reboot could help to lauch everything right.

Et voilÃ  !
