Guess what ? protection again !
Here I recommand you to look what ports scans are for (google is your friend).
Now, to protect your machine against it, portsentry is a solution.

Install it first : ~ apt-get install portsentry

now it will done nothing for you unless you configure it, and for that : ~ (sudo) nano /etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf
_ Port configuration : leave it as it is, because it's reasonable for us.
_ Advanced Stealth Scan Detection Options : again leave it like you find it, just add ports you'd liked not to be scanned.
_ Configurations Files : default is good you know ...
_ Misc. Configuration Options : RESOLVE_HOST = "1"
_ Response Options : well, didn't touch it, so your turn to do things if you want
_ Ignore options : BLOCK_UDP="1"
                   BLOCK_TCP="1"
_ Dropping Routes : comment every line except KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP"
_ TCP Wrappers : new style sounds nice
_ External Command : this is important, I personnaly put KILL_RUN_CMD="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP && /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -m limit --limit 3/minute --limit-burst 5 -j LOG --log-level debub --log-prefix 'Portsentry: dropping: '"
And this is a basic.
_ Scan Trigger Value : 0 is a good number to put
_ Port Banner Section : do you like to show off, here's your chance, but I recommand you to not

Something else you could use to make portsentry simpler and more efficient : 
open /etc/default/portsentry and change : 
TCP_MODE="atcp"
UDP_MODE="audp"
the ports list will be done automatically, only the open ports will be checked.

Et voil√† !
